This work is a culmination of my spare time as a passion project because I wanted to see differing dirt on aircraft as they flew in formation.  
I've been playing VTOL VR since 2019 and making liveries for it since it became possible, so i thought i'd try my hand at weathering.

-I plan on updating these and adding new airframes as they come out! so please consider donating to my ko-fi!-
