56 different layers of dirt total! (8 per airframe)

This was created entirely in my spare time over the last year as a passion project because I wanted to see differing dirt on aircraft as they flew in formation.  I've been playing VTOL VR since 2019 and making liveries (and scenarios: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2746015854) for it since it became possible, so i thought i'd try my hand at weathering.

-I plan on updating these and adding new airframes as they come out! so please consider donating to my ko-fi!-
